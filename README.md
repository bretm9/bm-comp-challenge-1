# Comp Challenge 1!

## About
This project was made for Turing's Comp Challenge 1. 
* I was asked to use an example composition to create a responsive layout with the same structure.
* This is a static page, meaning there are no working links or other interactivity. Don't worry, you're not supposed to be able to click on anything!
* I made use of both flexboxes and grids to create an organized, responsive layout. So grab your window and size it around to see all the various viewing options!
* I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) to find a color pallete. This part was a blast!  

## Screenshots

## Final Thoughts
All in all, this was a very excellent learning experience. Trying to match up my page with the provided layout was an interesting challenge, and I really enjoyed playing around with the color palette and other styling adjustments.
